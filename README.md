# Fixed-CSbot-Navigation
Latest csbot .nav file with bugfixed and optimization
works with CSBOT; Zbot and working with the latest ReGameDLL bots
There, not all navigation is corrected and optimized, there is only navigation created automatically by the cs 1.6 bot.
Maps deathrun_ ; surf_ ; kz_; hns_; BB_ are not supported by bot navigation and cannot work correctly so they are all deleted

I will try to refine and optimize the bots and improve their quality and performance by creating only important navigation for the bot without using an automatic navigation generator


in archive we have navigation test_gm.nav and they have problem with optimization<br>
