# Fixed-CSbot-Navigation
Latest csbot .nav file with bugfixed and optimization
works with CSBOT; Zbot and working with the latest ReGameDLL bots
There, not all navigation is corrected and optimized, there is only navigation created automatically by the cs 1.6 bot.
Maps deathrun_ ; surf_ ; kz_; hns_; BB_ are not supported by bot navigation and cannot work correctly so they are all deleted

I will try to refine and optimize the bots and improve their quality and performance by creating only important navigation for the bot without using an automatic navigation generator
## cs source and cs 1.6 & czero
## Maps fixed latest (cvars)


## Goals of the project about navigation maps
<ul>
<li>Provide more stable navigation for bots (than official auto navigation)</li>
<li>CPU performance optimization (for example, remove unnecessary areas from navigation and optimize areas)</li>
<li>bugfix</li>
</ul>
